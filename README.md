# Project-2
Artistic Turtle Drawing

My drawing displays a beautiful beach and ocean and the sky with clouds and the sun.  I wanted to use what I learned in the refraction assignment on replit about repitition and incorporate that into my project.  For example, my beach blankets and umbrellas were repeated four times with four different colours using just one function. Furthermore, to create the clouds, I used a for loop to create multiple circle that overlap and the use "pen.begin_fill" to fill in the circles with white colour.  The boats were created individually, then I created another function to repeat the creation of the boat and then move it to another location. I used another for loop to make two of those clouds.  In class, we did many examples similar to my sun in the drawing, so coding a sun was not too difficult. Drawing the people was sort of tricky and required a lot of code due to the many parts of a stick person.  Overall, I liked having the freedom to draw whatever I wanted and to be creative with my drawing, it made the project more enjoyable.
